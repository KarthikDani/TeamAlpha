It’s crucial for identifying and manipulating specific frequencies within an audio signal, enabling selective amplification of sounds as needed by the user’s hearing profile.\n\nA key equation used in Fourier analysis is the Fourier transform, which converts a time-domain signal into its constituent frequencies:\n\\[\nF(\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(t) e^{-j\\omega t} dt\n\\]"
